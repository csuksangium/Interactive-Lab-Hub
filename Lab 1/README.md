## Part A: Plan
A light source that illuminates to the color based on ambience of the environment
Maintenance person at night when there is insufficient light source to do work

  Setting:
  - Late night (ie. 2am), in a modern 600sqft studio highrise apartment in Brooklyn

  Players:
  - On-site maintenance person
  - Sleeping child
  - Pets (Dog, cat)
  - Husband, wife (tenant)

  Activity:
  Apartment unit has semi-emergency appliance & utilities issues at night that cannot wait until the morning to be fixed. Husband & wife require immediate repairs, so maintenance person is called over to fix the issue (ie. water leakage, fridge failure, heater failure in winter, AC failure in summer)
  
  - Maintenance person (main player) requires a light source to illuminate repair site
  - Husband & wife watches over maintenance person while repair is in progress
  - Child is sleeping
  - Pets are alerted when maintenance person enters the home

  Goals:
  - Maintenance person needs to repair the issue in the studio apartment
  - However, maintenance person wants to cause minimal disruption for the family's sleep cycle, especially the sleeping child
  - Husband, wife wants the repair to be done
  - Husband, wife does not want to wake the sleeping child
  - Pets want to greet/investigate the stranger entering the apartment

**#1: Night, dark repair. There is a sleeping child, so the light will account for shade that will minimally affect sleepers**

**#2: Day repair. There is a napping child, so the light will account for day shade as it does not require as much light**

![IMG_A4972CF803AC-1](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/1b3d3432-f709-4c0d-b63d-15571f265921)

**#3: Day repair. No one is sleeping, so the light will blast the maximum luminous efficacy to see dark repair under sink**

![IMG_0041](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/5fdc2c39-c09c-429c-ad91-9484d4a000b6)

**#4: Day fridge repair. No one is sleeping, but fridge has natural sun, so it will not light up to save battery**

![IMG_0042](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/e75b7043-56d4-4cb2-a59e-caeea367c1d8)

**#5: Day oven repair. Napping owl, so use gentle lighting**

![IMG_76E79D4EDE27-1](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/48e9b8c9-18dc-45a0-9e5c-45c9c0839a12)

**#6: Day oven repair. No one is home, so the light will blast the maximum luminous efficacy to see dark inside of the oven**

![IMG_0045](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/c11c9c46-dde2-462c-b2a9-4a42d7b069a6)

**#7: Day oven repair. Dog with young puppies, so the light will give warm gentle ambience to not distress the pets**

![IMG_0044](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/86754717-b2d0-404f-91ea-0631c2479616)

## Part B: Act out the interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

- I enjoy working with the overall concept because the product can be extended to other senses ie. sound, smell
  
**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
  
- Light source should be detachable. For example in certain repair circumstances it may be better on wrist instead of on head.

## Part C: Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**

I think Tinkerbelle is overall intuitive to use. Perhaps one small thing that could enhance user experience is by having a landing page popup to show instructions on its usage or contain example usage in github readme. Otherwise it is also slightly confusing concept for people unfamiliar with Tinkebelle character.

## Part D: Wizard the device

In my first time attempting to set up I am not able to open Tinkerbell on my mobile as shown below:

## Part E: Costume the device

Costume rough prototype: mounting light on a hat

![IMG_0047](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/22726c9c-b887-42e1-ae24-3c522c1de7f9)


The device itself is a light (#2), but it will come with 2 initial accessories to mount the light: hardhat and wristband
The product will be waterproof, shatterproof, and strong. It should be able to handle high humidity and heat as well as cold to handle all different repair situations (ie. Freezer repair, oven repair, pipe repair)

The unique diamond-shaped lock will be able to handle very high force, and the technology will be shared with partners to come up with other types of accessories the light would fit with.

## Part F: Record the interaction

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasnâ€™t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Part 2.A: Plan

**#1: Night, dark repair. There is a sleeping child, so the light will account for shade that will minimally affect sleepers, lullaby will be played to drown out the repair noise, and smell of lavender will be diffused in the room**

![IMG_8DDB761E6674-1](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/b51ea7db-424f-49fd-9f0e-45be53df6cf1)

**#2: Wireless earbuds that light up when detects foreign language and translates**

![IMG_0063](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/6b5defca-4390-4eb6-b2f2-07f4f392fedd)

**#3: Smart candle that releases smell, plays music, and chooses lighting based on the time**

![IMG_0064](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/a292a833-a83c-4643-a684-5f4b75446df7)


**#4: Mouse that lights up red and vibrates when it detects the user is not working. Turns green when productive**

![IMG_4DADBBB1950F-1](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/56d8eb82-7437-4561-b6db-b3e097a8a99d)


**#5: Shoes that light up based on how much you have walked that day**

![IMG_0070](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/b2d54f0a-56db-41c5-8a68-cc593b13c4db)

**#6: Speakers that changes color based on the music being played**

![IMG_0071](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/915ae3ee-7c1a-4c8b-8499-6cb5b8f55788)

**#7: Boxing glove that lights up corresponding color to quality of the punch**

![IMG_0066](https://github.com/csuksangium/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/24725647/b2c720df-cde1-46d6-9ebe-6d4c875a6aef)

## Part 2.B: Act out the interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

- Sound was a great addition to the concept, but smell is something that is a bit more difficult to act out and record.
  
**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

- The idea of adding smell and sound to the device came tp me as I was recording the interaction in part 1

## Part 2.E: Costume the device

I decided to build upon the concept that I explored in lab part 1 but incorporating other tangible sense: smell and sound, to make the device better overall as an immersive device.

## Part 2.F: Record the interaction

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Comments & Acknowledgement

For this project, I wanted to explore more ideas, but I joined this class on 08/31 and had to complete the project solo in 5 days, so I went with some of the first ideas that popped into my head. I also discovered that attempting to film alone was NOT easy, so I went with 1st person perspective for the recording. However, I enjoyed the entire process regardless as I got to self explore the various processes of staging interaction, particularly how ideas and creativity evolved throughout the process.

I was also having internet issues, so I opted for an app as a light source similar to Tinkerbell for some of the videos.
