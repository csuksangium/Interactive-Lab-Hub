## Overview

PolyPi is a language learning interactive device that aims to help users learn foreign language of choice. Users can interact with PolyPi and begin learning by looking at objects through the lens, and through object detection, PolyPi will identify objects in view and provide a translation. To set or change the language of PolyPi, users may simply say the language out loud, and PolyPi will do the rest. At launch, the supported languages are English, Spanish and French. Additionally, PolyPi can also be used to aid travellers who may require offline translation.
